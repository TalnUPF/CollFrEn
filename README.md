# CollFrEn: Rich Bilingual English–French Collocation Resource

This is the repository for the MWE-LEX 2020 (Coling 2020) paper: 

_Fisas, B., Espinosa-Anke, L., Codina-Filbà, J. & Wanner, L. (2020). CollFrEn: Rich Bilingual English–French Collocation Resource. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Multiword Expressions and Electronic Lexicons (MWE-LEX 2020). Coling 2020._

This is a collection of English and French collocations categorized according to their _lexical function_ [1], and enriched with manual translations and where each element of the collocationo (base and collocaet) are manually disambiguated against BabelNet [2]. We also release large-scale datases containing sentences where these collocations occur, which can be used for training MWE representations, or as a resource for corpus linguistics and lexicography. We also release _relation embeddings_, i.e., vector representations for the collocations using SeVeN [3]. In the `notebooks/` folder there are examples of how to load, explore and analyze this resource.
